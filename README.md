## What's this?

A small project replicating part of the LinkedIn UI exclusively for study purposes.
This is no part of any production or commercial endeavour and has solely the purpose of experimentation and study.

### Features implemented so far

- Theming (light/dark theme: tailwind CSS)
- Authentication (Google Oauth 2.0 authentication; next will be email/pwd auth)

This is part of a series of personal study projects that I group under the catchphrase "Attack Of The Clones" (aotc-).
The purpose here is to start from a real life example and show how I would re-implement/imagine part of those products with my current favourite tech stacks.


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

### Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
